=============

To setup:

  config.cfg needs changes:
  
  0 -> "MagRadF"
  
  1 -> "MagMixS"
  
  2 -> "MagFireS"
  
  3 -> "MagGrabS"
  
  4 -> "MagHealS"
  
  5 -> "MagRadialS"
  
  6 -> "MagMixF"

  8 -> "MagGrabF"
  
  9 -> "MagHealF"
  
  
  e -> "MagicFor"
  
  q -> "MagicBack"
  
  
How to play:

  My mod works through combining spells to deal higher levels of damage to opponents. 
  
  The only weapon you have is a blaster that turned into a melee weapon of sorts but insta-kills everything. 
  
  You also have the ability to dash forward and back with e and q, respectively. 
  
  By pressing the number buttons, you are able to cast spells for varying amounts of "mana".
  
  
  To restore mana, you must grab any weapon, ammo pack, and health pack available. 
  
  When you grab any item that isn't a health pack or armor pack, damage is dealt. 
  
  Also, in terms of how you dash. that also deals a piece of life and only works when health is more than 1.
  
  
  When you shoot your blaster, you'll notice how it isn't really hitting anything. You have to be up close to a target 
  
  to kill.
  
  On the other hand, if it lands, it's a 100% kill.
  
Magic combinations:

There are 5 types of magic, where each type has two speeds plus a combination type.


Special -> (pressing either 1 or 6)

     Deal no damage to players or enemies but have special properties when mixed with other spells.
     
     (1)
     
        Allows combinations with other spells except other versions of itself
        
     (6)
     
        Does not combine with any spell except with the spell cast with 1.
        
        Kills everyone when it hits a blast created by pressing [1]
        
Projectile -> (pressing 2 or 7)

    Fires a projectile that damages enemies
    
Grab -> (pressing 3 or 8)

    Grabs opposing clients and brings them over
    
Heal -> (pressing 4 or 9)

    Heals other clients on contact regardless of health
    
Radial -> (pressing 5 or 10)

    Throws a blast that doesn't hurt on contact but hurts if player is around radius
  
the special (1) creates sooped up versions of each spell based on collision


To create a combination:

  Based on the shot, it has to collide with a slow-moving special (1)
  
  The shot will be produced in the current direction of the player. 
  
  
In terms of UI stuff, the middle value is a fixed 200 for mana


If playing campaign, some of the spells differ from their deathmatch counterparts

  [1] = 100
  [2] = 5
  [3] = 25
  [4] = 5
  [5] = 10
  [6] = 200 (because this kills everyone when it hits [1])
  [7] = 10
  [8] = 25
  [9] = 10
  [0] = 30


Enjoy.
